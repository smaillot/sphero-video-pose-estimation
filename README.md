# Pose estimation of a Sphero robot from a webcam.
Really quick implementation to get the position of the Sphero given few points with known coordinates on the image.<br/>
Perform the conversion from camera frame to real life position by solving the DLT system.<br/>
Assume that the Sphero's LEDs are power on in blue or green colors on a neutral background.
